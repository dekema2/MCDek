// This is used to create custom $s
// If you start the line with a // it wont be used
// It should be formatted like this:
// $website:dekemaserv.com
// That would replace '$website' in any message to 'dekemaserv.com'
// It must not start with a // and it must not have a space between the 2 sides and the colon (:)
